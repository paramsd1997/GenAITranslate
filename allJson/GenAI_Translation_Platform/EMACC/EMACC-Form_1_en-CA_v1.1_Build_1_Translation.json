This guideline applies even if the relevant meaning of a word is of lower frequency than other meanings of the same word (for example, bat used as an animal has a lower frequency than bat used as baseball equipment but is still counted as correct for the Animals category). \nA response is correct if it is a specific member of the target category or if it is a subordinate category that can be used to denote a specific member (for example, fish for the Animals category). \nWords that represent the same ordinate level as the target category (for example, animal given for the Animals trial) are incorrect. Words that are superordinate to the target category also are incorrect. For instance, living things is superordinate to Animals because it also encompasses nonanimal living things (in other words, plants), and thus living things is incorrect. \nAdjectives given either alone or with the name of the target category are incorrect (for example, carnivorous or carnivorous animal would both be incorrect). Adjectives used to denote different attributes of the same category member are incorrect (for example, for the Vegetables trial, if the participant says, “onion, big onion, little onion,” the first response is correct, but the second and third responses are incorrect because they simply refer to different attributes of the same member). However, if the addition of an adjective results in a new member of the category (for example, onion, green onion, yellow onion), then all of those words are scored as correct. \nMany names are used for both boys and girls (for example, Chris, Pat, Sandy). These types of names are correct for either category. \nMany names are unusual (for example, Keilana, Dawayin) and are vague in terms of gender. The participant is given the benefit of the doubt, and such names are counted as correct. \nVariations of the same or similar name (for example, Catherine, Kate, Kathy or William, Bill, Billy) are all counted as correct. \nNicknames (for example, BJ, Junior) are all counted as correct. If the examiner is unsure that a word is a nickname, the participant is given the benefit of doubt and the response is scored as correct. \nLanguage variations of the same name (John, Juan) are all scored as correct.  \n&nbsp;",

On the other hand, if the ambiguous word is given along with&nbsp;other words that are clearly the names of people or places, the response is scored as&nbsp;incorrect. For example, for the S trial, if an examinee says, “Sally,&nbsp;Sandy, Sarah,”&nbsp;the word&nbsp;sandy&nbsp;in this context would be considered the name of a person and scored&nbsp;as an error (see the discussion on incorrect responses).&nbsp; \n&nbsp;If a word can be either a common word or a number (e.g.,&nbsp;for), it is scored as a common word unless (a) it is given along with other numbers (e.g., “four, five”), or (b)&nbsp;the examinee specifically clarifies that the response is a number. \nContractions (e.g.,&nbsp;aren’t, haven’t, hasn’t) are counted as correct if the first letter is&nbsp;correct for a particular trial. If an examinee says both the root word of a contraction&nbsp;and the contraction (e.g., “are” and then “aren’t” or “aren’t” and then “are”), both are&nbsp;scored as correct. \nCompound words (e.g.,&nbsp;air mail) are scored as correct but only as one response. If a&nbsp;response includes multiple compound words in which one of the words is the same&nbsp;(e.g., “apple, applesauce, apple juice, apple pie”), all are counted as correct. \nSlang words (e.g.,&nbsp;ain’t) and swear words that start with the correct letter are scored&nbsp;as correct responses. However, expletives should be noted clinically&nbsp; \nSome proper nouns are not names of people or places (e.g., months or days of the&nbsp;week). These proper nouns are counted as correct because the test instructions spe-cifically exclude only those proper nouns that are names of people or places. The&nbsp;names of some months may be confused with names of people (e.g.,&nbsp;April). If such&nbsp;a word is given along with the names of other months (e.g., “April, August”), it is&nbsp;scored as correct. On the other hand, if such a word is said along with other names&nbsp;of people (e.g., “April, Annie”), it is scored as incorrect.
